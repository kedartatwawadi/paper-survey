1. What is the difference between Face Recognition and Face Verification?
2. Labelled Faces in the wild
3. How do GPUs work? 
4. What is the workflow of a typical NN program? 
5. What is tthe difference in GPU designs? eg: NVIDIA K40
6. ResNet-50: Understanding why it works so well? 
7. How does the duality theorem from convex optimization work? 


## Quantization
- quantizing link weights using "weight sharing" 
- "Hessian weight" could be used to understand the importance of network parameters

## Pruning and sharing
- Biased weight decay pruning 
- Pruning based on "Hessian" or magnitude-based pruning
- HashedNets: share weights using a hash table
- Pruning with l1,l2 regularization requires more iterations for convergence (why?)
